/*
Write a command line program that takes a directory as an argument.
The program should check that the directory exists and is indeed a directory.  It should
then compute the size of all regular files in the directory itself and its sub-directories,
recursively.
Hint:  You may want to use Files.size, but remember only to use it on regular files.
You must traverse directories manually.

Get inspiration from df-utility from *nix
