/*
We want to model a double (2 vs.  2) badminton tournament.
Write a class to represent a badminton player.  A player has a first name, a last name,
an age, a number of won and lost matches, and an optional sponsor.  Write appropriate
constructors for the player class.  Add a method to the player class to compute that
playerâ€™s win-loss ratio.
Write a class to represent a team.  A team has a team name and consists of two players.
Add an appropriate constructor.  Add a method to compute the average age of the team.
Write a class to represent a single match between two teams, red and blue.  Add an
appropriate constructor.  Add a method to compute the average age of all the players
in the match.  Add a method to find the player with the best win-lost ratio of all the
players in the match.  Add a method to signal that one team has won/lost the match
and update the player statistics of each player accordingly.
